### Introduction
Soltrade is a Python-based, open source trading bot that we created in order to dive deeper into the workings of the blockchain and leap headfirst into the world of technical analysis. It integrates EMA, RSI, and Bollinger Band indicators into a customizable trading interval to predict the most profitable course of action. Jupiter has been integrated into Soltrade as well, allowing for near-instantaneous transactions with minimal fees. Soltrade is fairly customizable, with more user input to come in later versions. A ten-day chart demonstation of open and close positions with Soltrade's algorithm can be viewed below.

### Disclaimer
This software was created for education purposes only and, like all trading bots, cannot predict the future.
Please do not risk money you are not willing or cannot afford to lose. 
The creators and contributors of Soltrade are not responsible for any losses you might incur during trading.

### Setup
In order to use Soltrade you will need a free CryptoCompare API key and access to a wallet application such as Phantom.
Open the installation folder and create a file titled `config.json` with the following code block, replacing the placeholder values with your API key and wallet private key. Both keys are required to receive pricing data and perform trading transactions.
```
{
  "api_key": "<CryptoCompare API key>",
  "private_key": "<wallet_private_key>",
  "custom_rpc_https": "",
  "other_mint": ""
}
```
In addition to these required parameters, there are some additional ones that can be used as well.
Keep in mind that Jupiter often experiences issues when working with low slippage, so we recommend using at least a 0.5% fee or greater to minimize transaction issues.
